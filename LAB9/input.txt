Overturning elections sounds like the stuff of secret deals in
smoke-filled rooms, but President Donald Trumps not even trying to
hide his effort to subvert the results of the election as
President-elect Joe Bidens margin widens to more than 6 million
votes. Trumps efforts to deny Biden the White House traveled from
the courts to state legislatures on Friday with Trumps personal
reception with Republican lawmakers from Michigan -- and their
counterparts in Pennsylvania may be next on the list. But there
were signs, even among Republicans, that Trumps efforts need some
evidence. As legislative leaders, we will follow the law and
follow the normal process regarding Michigans electors, just as we
have said throughout this election, Michigan Senate Majority
Leader Mike Shirkey and Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield said
in a joint statement after their meeting at the White House.
